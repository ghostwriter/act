`Compliance` - `CI/CD` & `QA Testing`  Test Automation for `PHP` via `GitHub Actions`.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> This project is not finished yet, work in progress.

## Todo

- check the composer scripts section to see if the commands exists,
  - and report error/warning if not
  - and skip the job if not

- all tools should have a matching composer script name, i have already hardcoded
  the composer script for now, but this should be configurable (kebab case)
  - the command will be `composer compliance:composer-require-checker`
    - or `composer compliance:phpunit`
      - I like the `compliance:` prefix, that way if you have a `phpunit` script,
      - it will not cause a conflict with the `compliance:phpunit` script

- I will import the release automation into this project
- we will import the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` validation into this project
  - we will use the extensions field from the `composer.json` file to determine which PHP extensions to install
  - pass the extensions list as an argument to the docker image/workflow via shivammathur/setup-php@v2
     (looks like this part is already done, but we need to test it.)
  - i did most of this... but i need to test it.
  - we have everything we need to extract information from both composer files

> Woot woot!! we did it! we have a working prototype! ðŸŽ‰

-- we need to import gpg keys from GitHub secrets `GPG_KEY`,`GPG_FINGERPRINT`
--- to tag the release with a gpg signature
--- to sign binaries with a gpg signature
--- to sign the git commit with a gpg signature (automated composer.json update, if all tests pass)


- we need to add a command to add these commannds to the users composer.json file,
 for each supported tools they have in their composer.json file [`require` and `require-dev`].
 - if it does not exist, we will add it to the `scripts` section.
 - if it exists, continue.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "compliance:composer-require-checker": [
            "composer-require-checker check --config-file=composer-require-checker.json"
        ],
        "compliance:phpunit": [
              "@phpunit --configuration=phpunit.xml --coverage-clover=coverage.xml"
        ]
    }
}
```
